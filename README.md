Collectivo is an open-source platform for collaboration, participation, and data management. The software is designed to promote the active engagement and self-organization of members in community projects and organizations. With a modular structure, it can be easily customized to meet the needs of different users.

Collectivo is build on [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/), [Directus](https://directus.io/), and [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/). Features of the plattform are split into separate extensions, using [Nuxt Layers](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/layers). The software is designed to make it as easy as possible to develop additional extensions and integrate existing tools into the plattform.
