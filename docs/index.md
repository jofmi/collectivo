## Technical overview

Collectivo consists of three key applications:

-   **Community app**: The heart of Collectivo, a digital plattform for your community - built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/). It is easy to customize and extend, multilingual, and mobile-friendly.

-   **Data studio**: Collectivo uses [Directus](https://directus.io/) on the backend. This offers you a modern data studio to manage content, create visualizations, track changes, and automate workflows.

-   **Single sign-on**: Collectivo uses [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) for identity and access management. This makes it possible for users to have only one account for multiple applications.
