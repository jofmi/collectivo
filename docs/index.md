## A modular platform for your community

Collectivo is an open-source framework to build your own custom platform for collaboration, participation, and self-organization. The software is designed to make it as easy as possible customize to the needs of different communities and organizations, develop additional extensions, and integrate existing tools into the plattform. Good software for all :)

## Get in touch

If you are interested in using Collectivo or contributing to its development, please join the conversation on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/42MWureAYW), subscribe to our [Newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/79143ea8bd3c/collectivo), or write to [info@collectivo.io](mailto:info@collectivo.io).

## Technical overview

Collectivo consists of three key applications:

-   **Community app**: The heart of Collectivo, a digital plattform for your community - built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/). It is easy to customize and extend, multilingual, and mobile-friendly.

-   **Data studio**: Collectivo uses [Directus](https://directus.io/) on the backend. This offers you a modern data studio to manage content, create visualizations, track changes, and automate workflows.

-   **Single sign-on**: Collectivo uses [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) for identity and access management. This makes it possible for users to have only one account for multiple applications.
