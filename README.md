Collectivo is an open-source framework for buildig community platforms. It allows you to create a digital space, where users can interact with each other and organize together. Thanks to its modular design, the platform is completely flexible and can include [many different features](https://docs.collectivo.io/#features). Good software for all! :)

Collectivo is built on [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/), [Directus](https://directus.io/), and [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/). Features of the plattform are split into separate extensions, using [Nuxt Layers](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/layers). The software is designed to make it as easy as possible to develop additional extensions and integrate existing tools into the plattform.
